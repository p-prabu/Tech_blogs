# What is a Trust Relationship in Active Directory?

## Trust Relationships Overview
A **trust relationship** in Active Directory is a link between two domains that allows users in one domain to access resources in another domain. Trusts enable the sharing of resources and access control across multiple domains.

## Types of Trust Relationships
- **External Trusts**: Used to establish a trust relationship with domains in other forests.
- **Forest Trusts**: A trust between two forests that allows resources to be shared between domains in different forests.
- **Shortcut Trusts**: A trust that is used to optimize authentication between domains in a forest.

Trust relationships simplify resource sharing across different domains while maintaining security and control.
