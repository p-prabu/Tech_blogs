# What is Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)?

## What is AD LDS?
**AD LDS** is a directory service similar to Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), but it does not require a domain or domain controllers.

## When to Use AD LDS
- **Application-Specific Directory**: Useful for applications that need directory services without full AD.
- **Multiple Instances**: Multiple AD LDS instances can run on a single server.
- **No Domain Dependency**: Does not integrate with AD logins or domain structures.

AD LDS is useful when developers need directory features without the complexity of full domain infrastructure.
