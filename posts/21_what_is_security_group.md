# What is a Security Group in Active Directory?

## Security Group Overview
A **Security Group** in Active Directory is a type of group used to manage user rights and permissions to network resources. These are essential for controlling access to files, folders, printers, and other resources.

## Key Uses
- **Permission Assignment**: Assign access to resources like shared folders or printers.
- **Simplified Management**: Add or remove users from a group instead of configuring permissions individually.
- **Scope Options**: Global, Domain Local, and Universal groups can be used based on organizational needs.

Security Groups are critical in enforcing security policies and managing access control efficiently.
