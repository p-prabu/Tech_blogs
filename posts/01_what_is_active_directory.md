## Overview
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft to provide a centralized way to manage network resources such as users, computers, printers, and other devices in a networked environment. It plays a critical role in modern enterprise IT infrastructures, providing a means of organizing and controlling access to resources.

## Core Features
- **Centralized Management**: Active Directory allows IT administrators to manage permissions, security policies, and other critical network services from a central location.
- **User and Group Management**: AD enables organizations to store and manage information about users, groups, and devices.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: AD helps in authenticating users and devices, ensuring they are who they claim to be, and then authorizing them to access resources according to their permissions.

AD is based on a hierarchical structure and uses the **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** to provide services for network management. The main role of AD is to ensure secure authentication and authorization, centralize user management, and provide services like DNS, email routing, and file sharing.
