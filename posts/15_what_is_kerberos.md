# What is Kerberos Authentication?

## Kerberos Basics
**Kerberos** is the default authentication protocol used in Active Directory. It’s a secure method for authenticating a request for a service in a computer network.

## How It Works
- **Ticket-Based Authentication**: Kerberos uses time-limited tickets to prove identity without resending credentials.
- **Key Components**: Includes the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which issues tickets.
- **Mutual Authentication**: Ensures both the client and the server verify each other’s identity.

Kerberos is fast, secure, and prevents replay attacks, making it ideal for enterprise environments.
