# What is a Distribution Group in Active Directory?

## Overview
A **Distribution Group** is used to create email distribution lists. Unlike security groups, distribution groups cannot be used to assign permissions.

## Key Points
- **Email Only**: Designed for email communication, not security.
- **Exchange Integration**: Often used with Microsoft Exchange for managing email lists.
- **No ACL Support**: Cannot be used in access control lists for resource permissions.

Distribution Groups are best for organizational announcements and collaboration through email.
