# What is Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)?

## ADFS Explained
**ADFS** is a Microsoft service that provides Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for users to access applications across organizational boundaries.

## Key Features
- **Federated Identity**: Allows authentication across separate systems or domains.
