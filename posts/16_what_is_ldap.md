# What is LDAP in Active Directory?

## LDAP Overview
**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is an open protocol used to access and maintain distributed directory information services over a network.

## LDAP in AD
- **Used for Queries**: LDAP is used by apps and systems to search for users, groups, and other directory objects.
- **Standard Protocol**: Works over port 389 (or 636 for LDAPS - secure version).
- **Directory Read/Write**: Allows both read and write operations against AD.

LDAP enables centralized access to identity data in AD, making it crucial for integration with third-party applications.
