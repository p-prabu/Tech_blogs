## Organizational Units Explained
An **Organizational Unit (OU)** is a container within Active Directory that helps to organize objects such as users, groups, and computers. OUs provide a way to delegate administrative control over subsets of objects, making them easier to manage.

## Benefits of Using OUs
- **Delegated Administration**: By creating OUs, you can delegate administrative control over specific objects or subsets of objects to different individuals or teams without giving them control over the entire domain.
- **Group Policy Application**: OUs can be used to apply specific Group Policies to a group of users or computers, allowing for better management of settings on a granular level.
- **Simplified Management**: OUs help organize objects in a way that matches the organization's structure, making it easier to manage access, policies, and other configurations.
