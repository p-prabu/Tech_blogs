# What is a Group in Active Directory?

## Types of Groups
In Active Directory, a **group** is a collection of users, computers, or other groups. Groups are used to manage permissions and access to resources efficiently. There are two main types of groups:
- **Security Groups**: Used to assign permissions to resources (e.g., files, printers) within a domain.
- **Distribution Groups**: Used for email distribution lists and notifications.

## Benefits of Using Groups
- **Simplified Permissions Management**: By adding users to groups, you can apply permissions to an entire group rather than assigning permissions to each individual user.
- **Improved Security**: Groups allow for better control over access to network resources by controlling which groups have access to what resources.
- **Easier Administration**: Managing groups reduces the administrative burden of individually managing user permissions.
