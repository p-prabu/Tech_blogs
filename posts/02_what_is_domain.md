# What is a Domain?

## Defining a Domain in AD
A **domain** in Active Directory refers to a logical grouping of resources that share common rules and policies. It is the primary container for managing users, groups, and computers within a network. A domain is identified by a unique name, such as "company.com".

## Key Characteristics of Domains
- **Centralized Security**: The domain provides centralized security management, meaning that any changes to users' permissions or access rights are applied across all domain controllers.
- **Trust and Relationships**: Domains can trust other domains, allowing resources from one domain to be accessed by users from another domain. Trust relationships allow organizations to share resources without compromising security.
- **User Authentication**: Within a domain, users are authenticated through Domain Controllers (DCs), which validate user credentials and determine access rights to resources.
