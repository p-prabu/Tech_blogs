# What is the Global Catalog in Active Directory?

## Overview
The **Global Catalog (GC)** is a distributed data repository that contains a searchable, partial representation of every object in every domain in a forest.

## Importance of Global Catalog
- **Fast Searches**: Allows quick searching of AD objects across domains.
- **Logon Services**: Used during user logon to identify group membership.
- **Replication**: Stores a partial replica of objects from other domains.

Global Catalog servers are essential for multi-domain environments.
