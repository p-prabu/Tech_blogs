# 🔐 Azure AD Password Protection: Securing Your Organization

Weak passwords are one of the most common attack vectors. With Azure AD Password Protection, organizations can block commonly used and predictable passwords to significantly improve security posture — both in the cloud and on-premises.

---

## 🧠 Understanding Password Protection

Traditional AD policies enforce length, complexity, and history — but lack banned password controls. Azure AD Password Protection fills this gap by:

- Blocking predictable passwords (e.g., `companyname123`, `password@123`)
- Using a **global banned password list** maintained by Microsoft
- Allowing **custom enterprise-specific banned lists**

📌 **Example**  
If a user in the `Testlab.local` domain tries to set their password as `testlab123` or `password123`, Azure AD Password Protection will **block** it for being too predictable.

## 🔧 Implementation Overview

To use Azure AD Password Protection features:

### ✅ License Requirement
- Azure AD Premium P1 or P2

### 📍 Configuration Modes

| Mode         | Behavior                                          |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Audit**    | Allows weak password usage but logs the attempt   |
| **Enforced** | Blocks the reset and logs the blocked password    |

---

## 🛠 Configuration Steps (Cloud)

1. Go to **Azure AD** → **Security** → **Authentication Methods** → **Password Protection**
2. Enable **Enforced Mode** or **Audit Mode**
3. Define your **custom banned passwords list**
4. Save and apply

## 🏢 Deploying On-Premises

To enforce banned passwords in on-premises AD, install:

- **DC Agent** – Validates passwords on Domain Controllers
- **Proxy Agent** – Syncs password policies from Azure

### 📦 Installation Steps

1. Install **DC Agent** on all domain controllers  
2. Install **Proxy Agent** on at least two domain-joined servers  
3. Register the services using PowerShell (refer to [Microsoft official docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bannedpasswords))  
4. Restart services and verify logs

### 🔁 Process Flow

- DCs discover proxy agents via **SCP (Service Connection Point)**
- Proxy agents fetch the latest policies from **Azure AD**
- DC agents **enforce banned password rules** during resets

---

## 👨‍💻 Practical Demonstration

### Admin Scenario
An admin tries resetting a user's password using a **banned phrase** → Reset is blocked and event is logged.

### User Scenario
A user attempts to set a weak password like `welcome2024` → Password change is **denied** and logs are generated.
